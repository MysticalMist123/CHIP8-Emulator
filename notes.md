# To learn:
1. c headers and how to include custom c files
2. learn gitignore

# components:
1. memory
2. Registers
   a. program counter
   b. index-register
   c. 16 8-bit registers
3. stack
4. Instruction cycle (includes loader)
5. Timers

#Notes
1. 1 instruction executed in 1 cycle. 700 cycles per second
2. if something goes wrong regarding the timings, then either, try using time instead of number of instructions to update timers, OR remove the concept of clock cycles (700 hz)
