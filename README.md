This is my first Emulator, so I might have made some rookie mistakes. Hope it doesn't bother you too much. :)

- Language: C
- Display: raylib
- System: Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS x86_64

## Setup
1. Install raylib. Link to installation instructions: https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/Working-on-GNU-Linux 
2. After cloning this repo, add your desired CHIP-8 ROMs to 'ch8_files' directory.
3. Go to instructionCycle.c file, and change the filename (on line 17), to the ROM to be executed.

## Running the emulator
Run the below commands:  
'''

./compile.sh  
./test

'''
